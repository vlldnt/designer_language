## Personas & User Journeys

Based on these findings, the UX Research team gathered data and conducted user interviews

Here are a few personas that illustrate different segments of the user base for this challenge

- **Alex**, student, wants to find better focus while studying *(Persona – Alex.pdf / User Journey Map – Alex.pdf)*
- **Michelle**, nurse practitioner, wants to discover new genres *(Persona – Michelle.pdf / User Journey Map – Michelle.pdf)*
- **Regina**, retired, wants to build a library of saved songs based on her tastes *(Persona – Regina.pdf / User Journey Map – Regina.pdf)*

### UX to be changed
The UX needs to be changed to offer a choice between different user profiles (personas)
The interface should allow the user to identify with one of the proposed personas so the experience can be adapted to their specific needs

**Differences**
- Alex prioritizes focus and simplicity (playlists adapted for studying)
- Michelle seeks discovery and variety (exploring new genres)
- Regina values organization and memory (creating a personalized library)
