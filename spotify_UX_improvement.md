## Persona Choosen: Michelle
Michelle, 42, is a nurse practitioner in Lafayette, Louisiana, and has a Master of Science in Nursing. She has a busy life taking care of her four children while supporting her husband, who is a Marine. She enjoys music to relax and motivate her family in the morning, but struggles to explore new genres because Spotify mainly recommends her kids’ favorites. She cannot afford another account and wants to manage everything on a single account

## Brainstorm and Ideas

| #   | ***Team's ideas***                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | **Michelle's mood**: Three mood bubbles illustrating 3 moments of Michelle's day (morning, noon, evening)                                            |
| 2   | **A “random” button**: click to discover a song you might not like — or that could become your next favorite. |
| 3   | **Guided onboarding**: reduce confusion by helping users find their musical tastes through a quick 3-question quiz.   |
| 4   | **Emotional accessibility**: a UX designed for someone who is tired after work, requiring less cognitive effort.              |
| 5   | **Family Profile**: Switch between child/adult accounts within the same profile, with color by profile         |
| 6   | **Enhanced Sidebar**: Add a content filter (adult/child/both) in the left panel         |
| 7   | **Optimized Suggestions**: Reduce playlist recommendations from 10 to 5 titles          |
| 8   | **Hyper-Personalized Song Suggestions**: Introduce a **"Suggested Songs" playlist** dynamically updated based on the user's **listening history**, **liked tracks**, and **self-created playlists** |
| 9   | **"Search for Me" Button**: Add a **one-click button** (e.g., in the "Explore" tab) that generates **personalized artist/genre cards** based on her filters (e.g., "Jazz," "Indie Folk"), with visual previews of recommended tracks |



## Decide: choose the idea to elaborate

- ***Mood & Accessibility (1 + 4):***
Three mood bubbles (morning, noon, evening) with playlists, designed for low-effort use when tired

- ***Smart Onboarding & Personalized Suggestions (3 + 7 + 8):***
Quick 3-question quiz + fewer, clearer recommendations (max 5) + a “Suggested Songs” playlist updated dynamically

- ***Family Profile (5):***
Switch between child/adult profiles, color-coded for clarity

- ***Enhanced Sidebar (6):***
Content filter (adult/child/both), integrated with profiles and new buttons

- ***"Search for Me" Button (9):***
One click to generate visual cards of artists/genres based on filters (e.g., Jazz, Indie Folk)
