# Persona: Michelle

## Story
Michelle, 42, is a nurse practitioner in Lafayette, Louisiana, and has a Master of Science in Nursing. She has a busy life taking care of her four children while supporting her husband, who is a Marine. She enjoys music to relax and motivate her family in the morning, but struggles to explore new genres because Spotify mainly recommends her kids’ favorites. She cannot afford another account and wants to manage everything on a single account

| 1   | **Family Profile**: Switch between child/adult accounts within the same profile, with color by profile         |
| 2   | **Enhanced Sidebar**: Add a content filter (adult/child/both) in the left panel         |
| 3   | **Optimized Suggestions**: Reduce playlist recommendations from 10 to 5 titles          |
| 4   | **Hyper-Personalized Song Suggestions**: Introduce a **"Suggested Songs" playlist** dynamically updated based on the user's **listening history**, **liked tracks**, and **self-created playlists** |
| 5   | **"Search for Me" Button**: Add a **one-click button** (e.g., in the "Explore" tab) that generates **personalized artist/genre cards** based on her filters (e.g., "Jazz," "Indie Folk"), with visual previews of recommended tracks |
